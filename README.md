## Aim
The aim of this notebook is to learn some basic Quantum computing principles, by exploring Grover's search algorithm. This algorithm is a highly effective quantum searching algorithm with significantly less complexity. This makes it a favorable technique for searching through large unstructured and unsorted datasets. As quantum computers improve in size, cost, maintanance and operating requirements, this algorithm will be a favored search algoirth. Thus, it is worth exploring as it provides good insight into th eposibilities of quantum computing. It is also important to understand the concepts of noise and how actual quantum devices run rather than just using ideal simulators.

To do this, there are 2 main learning sections::
1. Quantum Computing Crash Course
2. Grover's Algrithm Realisation, implementation and testing.

### Quantum Computing Crash Course:
This section introduces users to the concepts of Quantum Computing. This includes insight into the following:
1. 
2. 

### Grover's Algrithm
This section is used to adance on the basic concepts learned in the first section, and applying it to a useful algorithm. Step by step, the learneres are introduced into the different components of Grover's algorithm and their interconnection. The section conlcudes with testing the developed circuitry through simulators and actual quantum devices. This teaches, using experience, how a qantum algorithm and circuit may be affected in operating conditions.
